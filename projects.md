## Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Subtypes: A Mathematical Model Assessing Cardiovascular and Kidney Risks using the _All of Us_ Database

**Description:** This research uses a data-driven approach to predict the influence of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) subtypes in developing cardiovascular and kidney complications. The NIH _All of Us_ research database was leveraged to evaluate healthy and T2DM cohorts. The cohort data was then cleaned and used in unsupervised k-means clustering to identify four distinct and replicable subtypes. An SEIR model was created and parameters were estimated using clustered data. Continuing progress will consider undiagnosed and prediabetic populations.

**Technologies:** Python, MATLAB, R, _All of Us_ Workbench platform
