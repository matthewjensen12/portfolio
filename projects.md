## Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Subtypes: A Mathematical Model Assessing Cardiovascular and Kidney Risks using the _All of Us_ Database

**Description:** This research uses a data-driven approach to predict the influence of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) subtypes in developing cardiovascular and kidney complications. The NIH _All of Us_ research database was leveraged to evaluate healthy and T2DM cohorts. The cohort data was then cleaned and used in unsupervised k-means clustering to identify four distinct and replicable subtypes. An SEIR model was created and parameters were estimated using clustered data. Continuing progress will consider undiagnosed and prediabetic populations.

**Technologies:** Python, MATLAB, R, _All of Us_ Workbench platform

**Status:** In Progress

**Code:** [Link to your code - see Part C below]

## Chocolate Ratings

**Description:** Created an RShiny App that utilizes interactive features for a user to explore chocolate ratings based on a dataset in kaggle. The user can select a country and the app will display its top rated chocolate companies as well as highlight the countries where they source the most cocoa beans from. Beyond this country specific scale, global data is also incorporated, displaying the countries with the highest and lowest cocoa percentages and their ratings. Lastly, it displays a violin plot to show the distribution of the ratings based on ingredient sets in the chocolate bars.

**Technologies:** R, RShiny

**Status:** Complete
